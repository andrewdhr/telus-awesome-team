MDL v1.3 adds some fixes that have been committed since 1.2.1, as well as a new feature.


## **New: prevent automatic upgrading**

[@AlexanderOtavka](https://github.com/AlexanderOtavka) [added the ability to disable auto-upgrading](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/commit/ef69a4a666b8335f52ecc09d88f86d09da24c67b)! This is useful if you want to manage the component lifecycle yourself, such as if you're integrating with a framework.

In order to do this, register an event listener for the `mdl-componentupgrading` event. Once you receive an event, you can choose whether or not to cancel it, giving you control on a per-component basis.


## **Bug fixes and improvements**



* [@chajath](https://github.com/chajath) [added an option to disable JS layout switching](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/commit/b353f83e09769bdaafc2c2377d8b09e5450b1f5e)
* [@MitchLillie](https://github.com/MitchLillie) [improved tab handling to allow more types of links](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/commit/14b6cb1c52c32009427110c9da130e9ae7eac895)
* [@leocaseiro](https://github.com/leocaseiro) added the `mdl-card--border` option to `mdl-card__supporting-text`(<code>[4ee5202](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/commit/4ee5202c6c934096ad8edfe7eb94fc29f133e42d)</code>)
* [@enniel](https://github.com/enniel) fixed a bug with spinners and some documentation typos
* [@pndewit](https://github.com/pndewit) fixed a bug with vertical alignment in radios

## **MDC-Web and plans for the future**

As you may have noticed, an alpha for [Material Components for the web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) (MDC-Web) was recently released.

MDC-Web started life as version 2 of Material Design Lite, but has since evolved into a project of its own, with a broader team and a strong focus on providing a high-quality Material Design implementation for all of the web.

Here are some of the highlights of what you can expect:



* Modular components, served as independent NPM packages (as well as a large all-in-one meta-package)
* Manual lifecycle control, with an opt-in auto-init option
* Stronger focus on progressive enhancement, performance, and accessibility
* Internals built with low-level architecture to facilitate integration into frameworks
* Still fully vanilla: no polyfills or frameworks needed

The project is still in its alpha stage, so expect to find a lot of missing components, and to see significant churn as we make changes based on your feedback!


### **What happens to Material Design Lite?**

Material Design Lite (v1) will remain available, with limited support. We don’t have the resources to fully maintain both projects, so we won’t be doing any further development on MDL ourselves.

That said, we’ll do our best to be around to fix critical bugs and accept PRs from the community, as well as release those in new versions. This model has worked well ever since we started the v2 work that eventually resulted in MDC-Web, with new components, new features, and many bugfixes contributed since then.

With this approach, we plan to give developers time to migrate to MDC-Web as the project matures and the community grows.
